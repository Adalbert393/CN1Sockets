#Codename Sockets Library

This library was started as an attempt to add sockets support to Codename One.  I have so far created native interfaces for iOS, Android, Blackberry, and J2ME, but **NONE OF IT HAS BEEN TESTED**.

I stopped development of this library when I discovered that Codename One doesn't support native interfaces for the JavaSE port - i.e. it would be very difficult to test apps made with this library.  They have stated that this will be added in the near future, at which time, I may continue development of this library.

As it stands now it can, perhaps, serve as an example of how to create native interfaces in Codename One.
